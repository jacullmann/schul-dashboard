 * entering. A card leaves the map once settled: moving a card in the list
 * re-inserts its node, which restarts its animations.
 *
 * While `held`, the list sits behind a skeleton and may still reorder as it
 * loads, so the order is only taken once the cards are actually shown. The
 * cards then take over the skeleton rows' places in the entrance, starting at
 * `skeletonOrder`, and continue from wherever those rows had got to.
