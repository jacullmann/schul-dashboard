//! The security audit log (`security_events`): sign-ins, changes to how an
//! account is secured, access to groups and every admin action.
//!
//! It is kept apart from the activity log on purpose. Entries outlive the
//! accounts and groups they name, can be about attempts against no known
//! account, are append-only in the database and are kept longer (see the
//! `security_audit_log` migration). An event is recorded in the transaction
//! of the change it describes wherever there is one, so a change is never
//! committed without its entry.
